            <h2>Trouble Afoot in Blisspost</h2>
            <p><strong>Sherrif Lais has announced just yesterday that an Adult Black Dragon has been spotted flying over Redrock Mountain.</strong> This comes as a suprise, as Blisspost has been under the protection of local Ancient Copper Dragon Konaisik for centuries. </p>
            <p><em>Both the Sherrif's office and Konaisik are investigating the sighting.</em> So there should be very little to be concerned of, but readers should still stay safe and avoid Redrock for the time being.</p>
            <h3>Places Recommended To Avoid</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Redrock Mountain</li>
                <li>Fervor Swamp</li>
                <li>Umbral Cave</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Reasons To Avoid These Places</h4>
            <dl>
                <dt>Redrock Mountain</dt>
                <dd>It is where the Dragon was last spotted.</dd>
                <dd>Dragons are well known to frequent mountains.</dd>
                <dt>Fervor Swamp</dt>
                <dd>Black Dragons are known to make lairs in swamps.</dd>
                <dd>If the Dragon has made its lair here, the natural wildlife will be upset.</dd>
                <dt>Umbral Cave</dt>
                <dd>This is thought to be a local frequented by evil creatures and monsters.</dd>
            </dl>
            <h5>Additional Info</h5>
            <blockquote>It would be safest keeping away from the swamp and Redrock for now.</blockquote>
            <h2>Sherrif Election</h2>
            <p>The Sherrif Elections is coming up this Friday. Newcomer Dagon Sav has thrown his hat into the ring. That makes three candidates for Sherrif this year, though we here at the Blisspost Digest don't expect an upset this year. The current candidates goes as follows: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sherrif Mako Lais</li>
                <li>Dagon Sav</li>
                <li>John Corrie</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When asked why he was running, Sav has this to say; <q>Sherrif Lais is a good guy, but he's been sherrif for too long.</q></p>
